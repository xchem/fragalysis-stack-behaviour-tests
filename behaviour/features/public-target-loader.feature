Feature: Verify legitimate public Targets can be loaded into the stack

  This feature ensures that target data located on an S3 bucket
  (expected to have been generated by XChem-Align)
  can be loaded into a new stack against the public proposal.
  We rely on a clean stack and a CAS-authenticated user.

  The steps rely on 'sensitive' material that is expected to be provided
  by environment variables. The tests will alert if these are not set.

  Background: Start with a new (empty) stack

    Create a new (up to date) stack and pass-in some important extra variables
    using the steps's 'doc string', which will be passed to the AWX template.

    Given an empty behaviour stack tagged latest
      """
      {
        "stack_disable_restrict_proposals_to_membership": "yes"
      }
      """
    Then the landing page response should be OK

  Scenario Template: Load public targets

    Load target files (located in an S3 bucket) into the stack.
    The target files are expected to be in a TGZ format,
    checking the upload status and subsequent API responses.

    Given I can login to the behaviour stack
    And I can access the im-xchem-data bucket
    When I get the TGZ encoded file <tgz>
    And I load it using target access string lb18145-1
    Then the response should be ACCEPTED
    And I should get a Task status endpoint
    And the Task status should have a value of SUCCESS within <timeout> minutes
    When I call /api/target_experiment_uploads
    Then the length of the returned list should be 1
    When I call /api/targets?title=<target>
    Then the length of the returned list should be 1

    Examples:
    | target  | tgz                                 | timeout |
    | A71EV2A | lb32627-66_v2.2_upload_1_2024-12_09 | 7       |
